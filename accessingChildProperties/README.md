## React Bible

Welcome to React code snippet library. This project has been created for educational purposes with the goal of having references and case studies to apply technological solutions with **React**.

### How it works 

Each folder is an isolated example.

Some of the examples requires **node**, so be sure to have it. Don't worry, for complex examples, I will create private readme files. 

Most of these examples are not taking in account the compilation of JSX assets. Educational purpose only at the moment.

To run these examples in a stable and simple server, just install **httpster**

```
$ npm install -g httpster
```


### Sources

Some of the example are created by me, others are based, curated, reworked or optimized on:
