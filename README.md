## React Bible

Welcome to React code snippet library. This project is created with educational purposes with the objective to have references and case studies to apply technological solutions with **React**.

### How it works 

Each folder is an isolated example.

Some of the examples works with **node**, so be sure to have it. Don't worry, for complex example, I will create private readme files. 

Most of this example are not taking in account the compilation of jsx assets. Educational purpose only at the moment.

### Sources

Some of the example are created by me, others are based on:
